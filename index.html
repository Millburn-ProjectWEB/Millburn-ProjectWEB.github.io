    <h3>Our organization aims to specialize in providing beginner to advanced level
         web development classes for everyone. Anyone who is interested can join 
         for classes, and we hope to create a community of people who share our
          passion for designing and building creative applications. We will
           start small, one or two classes a week, teaching the fundamentals of HTML,
            CSS, and Javascript, skills that are necessary for any future endeavors 
            into front-end development (overarching term to encompass all 
            applications with user interfaces). If enough interest is created,
             we plan for the organization to expand, by including more staff and 
             more regular weekly classes. We will incorporate more advanced concepts, 
             such as frameworks and libraries (React (for responsive single-page applications),
            Three.js (3D visualizations on the web), Flask (accessing APIs and communicating between the front end and back end)). 
            Maybe create a summer camp for younger students? You will be able to sign up for classes on this website through our portal, 
            and expect for the first classes to start in about a month.</h3>
    <h2>Our founders</h2>

    <h3 style = "line-height: 150%;">This organization was founded by two high schoolers - Benjamin Li and Ritvik Gupta. Both founders are experienced in web and app development, and have worked on numerous  projects. We noticed how prone to bugs web development is and how these bugs block your learning, so we conceived the idea of live lessons with instructors to help accelerate the process.  </h3>
    
    <h2>Why Join?</h2>

    <h3>Whether you're considering a job in the software space, learning web development as a pastime, or a blogger, our organization accomodates for everyone's needs. In contrast to existing, self-paced options, ProjectWEB’s live sessions with instructors allows instant communication and exponentially faster debugging. We also tailor our content to students’ interests so they can benefit the maximum amount from our courses. In addition to this, we look to provide students who would like to explore more outside of class or enhance their knowledge with an extensive catalog of informative videos.
